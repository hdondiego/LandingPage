Project Name: Lab 2 / Azure Landing Page\
This repository satisfies question 2 (Azure Landing Page).\
I used template code from DigitalOcean for the page fade-in when the page is first opened.\
(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-simple-page-fade-in)\
The following are required build files: index.html and main_design.css\
The Landing Page holds the current week's assignments, the assignments for future weeks, and \
the links to the Dice Roller game and Course Syllabus.\
